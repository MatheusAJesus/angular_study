  <!--How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to console.log()  the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.

  Important: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

  The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for YOUR_ELEMENT properties  or YOUR_ELEMENT events  should yield nice results.-->
